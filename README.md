# LLAMA LangChain Demo 🦙🔗

Welcome to the LLAMA LangChain Demo repository! This project showcases how to utilize the LangChain framework and Replicate to run a Language Model (LLM). The code in this repository replicates a chat-like interaction using a pre-trained LLM model.

## 📜 Overview

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook (`LLAMA_langchain.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to:

- Install the necessary libraries `langchain` and `replicate`
- Use Replicate to interact with the LLM model
- Load tools and initialize an agent for chat-like interactions
